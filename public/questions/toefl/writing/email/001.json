I am writing to respectfully request a one-week extension on the research paper due this Friday, March 22nd.\n\nUnfortunately, I have been seriously ill with the flu since Monday and have been unable to work on my assignments. I have a doctor's note confirming my condition, which I am happy to provide upon request.\n\nThe additional week would allow me to recover fully and produce the quality of work your course deserves.\n\nThank you very much for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",
