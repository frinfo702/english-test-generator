  "title": "The Formation of Coral Reefs",
  "passage": "Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth. These structures are built by tiny marine animals called coral polyps, which secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons. Over thousands of years, these skeletons accumulate to create massive reef formations.\n\nThere are three main types of coral reefs: fringing reefs, which grow directly from shorelines; barrier reefs, which are separated from land by lagoons; and atolls, which are ring-shaped reefs encircling a central lagoon.\n\nCoral reefs require warm water temperatures between 23-29 degrees Celsius, clear shallow water that allows sunlight to penetrate, and low nutrient levels. Climate change poses a significant threat, as rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, a process where corals expel their symbiotic algae, losing both color and their primary food source.",
